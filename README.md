🚀 Progress Update: DEPI Egypt Track - VAPT Week 3 🚀

Excited to share what I’ve learned during Week 3 of the DEPI Egypt Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) track! This week was packed with hands-on exercises, in-depth explorations, and valuable insights into malware, security processes, and cyber hygiene. Here's a breakdown:

# 💻 Types of Malware and Their Characteristics
Explored five common types of malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware, Spyware).
Learned how they spread (email attachments, infected websites, removable media).
Analyzed their impact on systems like data theft, system hijacking, and corruption.
Investigated real-world examples like ILOVEYOU Virus, WannaCry Ransomware, and Pegasus Spyware to understand their devastating effects and tactics.

# 🛡️ Common Attacks
Practiced recognizing and mitigating common attack methods in real-world scenarios.
Improved cyber hygiene with strategies to stay safe online.
Hands-on practice via this TryHackMe room.

# 📧 Phishing Emails in Action
Learned to identify phishing email indicators through practical examples.
Gained a sharper eye for spotting malicious intent in everyday emails.
Check out the TryHackMe room I used: Phishing Emails.

# 🔄 SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)
Gained foundational knowledge of SDLC phases and processes.
Explored the critical role of lifecycle management in software development.
Details in this TryHackMe room.

# 🔒 SSDLC (Secure Software Development Lifecycle)
Delved into securing the SDLC processes with S-SDLC.
Learned methodologies to integrate security into every phase of development.
Explored this key concept through this TryHackMe room.
What’s Next?

I’m excited to continue deepening my skills and sharing my journey. If you’re also navigating the cybersecurity world, I’d love to connect and exchange insights!
